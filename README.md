<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Meelks</h1>
<p align="justify">In my quest as a BS Computer Science student, I'm currently on Level 3 here at New Era University. My best attributes are software end-to-end testing, understanding patterns, employing logical strategies, and writing clean and efficient code. Apart from the main quest, I also do side quests like exploring other programming languages and joining competitions (ex: Kaggle) -- all for a slightly cooler skin (just kidding). Of course, it's all to increase my XP. Get to know me more by checking my stats below and the collection of repositories I've crafted throughout my journey. Whow knows? Maybe we'll teamup someday.</p>
